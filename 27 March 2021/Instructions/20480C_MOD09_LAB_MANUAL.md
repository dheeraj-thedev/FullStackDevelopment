## Module 9: Adding Offline Support to Web Applications

Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20480 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20480 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20480**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20480C\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20480\AllFiles\20480C\Mod01**.

## Lab: Adding Offline Support to Web Applications

#### Scenario

The conference organizers are concerned that the venue has poor Wi-Fi coverage in some locations, so the attendees might not always be able to access the conference website on their tablets and laptops. The **Schedule** page is especially important because attendees need to know when sessions are running.

You have decided to make parts of the web application available offline by using the offline web application features of HTML5. After an attendee has visited the online website once, their browser will have downloaded and cached the important pages. If a Wi-Fi connection is unavailable, the attendee will still be able to view the website by using the cached information.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use the Application Cache API to make webpages available offline.
- Use the Local Storage API to persist user data locally between browser sessions.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **60 minutes**

### Exercise 1: Caching Offline Data by Using the Application Cache API

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will make the **Home**, **About**, **Schedule**, and **Location** pages available offline.

First, you will complete the creation of an application manifest file, which lists all the files that should be cached for offline access. Next, you will reference the manifest file from the **Home**, **About**, **Schedule**, and **Location** pages. Then, you will write a JavaScript code that adapts the page navigation, hiding links to pages that are not available offline. Finally, you will run the application and view the **Schedule** page. You will stop the web server, and then reload the **Schedule** page to verify that it works offline.

#### Task 1: Configure the application cache manifest

1.	To enable support for application caching, configure Microsoft Edge:
- Start Microsoft Edge.
- To display the menu bar, in Microsoft Edge, press F10.
- On the **Tools** menu, click **Internet options**.
- In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click **Settings**.
- In the **Website Data Settings** dialog box, click the **Caches and databases** tab.
- Select the **Allow website caches and databases** check box, and then click **OK**.
- In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click **OK**.
- Close Microsoft Edge.
2.	Start Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. Browse to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod09\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, and then open the **ContosoConf.sln** solution.
4.	Open the **appcache.manifest** file. This file contains a partial application manifest that lists the resources that a web browser must cache for offline access. 
5.	After the comment near the start of the file, insert the following URLs to cache the **Home**, **About**, **Schedule**, and **Location** pages:
   ```javascript
        /index.htm
        /about.htm
        /location.htm
        /schedule.htm
   ```
6.	Add the **manifest="/appcache.manifest"** attribute to the **&lt;html&gt;** element of the **Home**, **About**, **Schedule**, and **Location** pages. These are the pages that will operate offline by using the application cache. 

#### Task 2: Detect offline mode by using JavaScript code

1.	In the **scripts** folder, open the **offline.js** file. This script contains methods that hide or show links depending on whether a page is currently running in the online or offline mode. The pages that support the offline mode reference this script.
2.	After the __// TODO:__ comment, if currently in the offline mode, hide navigation links that require the online mode, add JavaScript code to detect if the web browser is currently offline, and then call the **hideLinksThatRequireOnline()** function.
- Examine the **navigator.onLine** property to determine whether the browser is online or offline.
3.	After the comment that starts with __// TODO:__, add the **onoffline** and **ononline** events to **document.body**, handle the **ononline** and **onoffline** events for the document body, and then call the **hideLinksThatRequireOnline** and **showLinks** functions as appropriate.
4.	After the __// TODO:__ comment, handle the **applicationCache** error event to hide links, and then add an event listener to the **applicationCache error** event, which calls the **hideLinksThatRequireOnline** function.

#### Task 3: Test the application

1.	Run the application, and then open the **index.htm** page.
2.	Expand the Windows notification area, right-click **IIS Express**, and then select **Exit**. Allow **IIS Express** to exit when prompted.

>**Note**: When **IIS Express** first starts running, the **IIS Express** icon may appear in the taskbar rather than the notification area. If this occurs, right-click the **IIS Express** icon, and then select **Exit**.

3.	In Microsoft Edge, open the **Schedule** page. Verify that the page loads and displays the schedule information. Also verify that after a brief delay, the **Register** link in the navigation bar is removed. This occurs because the **Register** page is not cached (it is not included in the **appcache.manifest** file), and registration requires an active connection to the website.
4.	View the **About** page, verify that this page displays correctly, and then verify that the **Register** link disappears from the navigation bar.
5.	Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have modified the web application and made the **Home**, **About**, **Schedule**, and **Location** pages available offline.

### Exercise 2: Persisting User Data by Using the Local Storage API

#### Scenario

Currently, the **Schedule** page is able to display sessions when offline, but this information does not include whether the attendee selected the session by using the star icon. This information is stored on a remote server that is inaccessible when the application is running offline. However, attendees also need to see the sessions they have selected. This information should be saved locally on an attendeeâ€™s computer, so that it is available offline.

In this exercise, you will update the JavaScript code for the **Schedule** page to record an attendee's selected sessions. You will create an object that wraps the Local Storage API. Then, you will use this wrapper to save information locally about starred sessions. Finally, you will run the application, view the **Schedule** page, and then verify that the starred sessions are persisted even when the web server is not available.

>**Note**: The Local Storage API is very simple. It can only save and load string key-value pairs. Persisting more complex data requires serialization. In this exercise, you will use a wrapper around the Local Storage API.

#### Task 1: Observe the current behavior of the Schedule page

1.	In Visual Studio, browse to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod09\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 2**, and then open the **ContosoConf.sln** solution.
2.	Run the application, and then open the **schedule.htm** page.
3.	Close **IIS Express** by using the icon in the Windows notification area.	
4.	On the **Schedule** page, click some of the stars, and then refresh the page.
	Notice that the application does not save the information about which sessions are starred when the application is running offline (the yellow stars turn white again).
5.	Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 2: Save information about starred sessions to local storage

1.	In the **scripts** folder, open the **LocalStarStorage.js** file. To provide a higher-level interface used by the application code, the code in this file wraps the Local Storage API.

>**Note**: The **Schedule** page will use the **addStar**, **removeStar**, **isStarred**, and **initialize** functions defined in this file. These functions call the **save** and **load** methods that you will implement in this task.

2.	Implement the **LocalStarStorage save** method.
- The IDs of the starred sessions to be saved are held in the **this.sessions** array.
- Convert the array to a string by using the **JSON.stringify** function.
- Save this string to local storage with the **stars** key.

#### Task 3: Load information about starred sessions from local storage

In the **LocalStarStorage.js** file, implement the **LocalStarStorage load** method.
   - Get the **stars** item from local storage.
   - Parse the JSON string into an array, and then assign it to **this.sessions**.
   - Handle the cases when the local storage returns no data or a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) that is not valid. In these situations, set **this.sessions** to be an empty array.

#### Task 4: Use the local storage wrapper to save and load data in the Schedule page

1.	In the **scripts** folder, open the **ScheduleItem.js** page.
2.	In the **initialize** method, find the following comment:
   ```javascript
        // TODO: Check if item is starred
   ```
3.	Add a JavaScript code after this comment:
- To detect whether the session identified by **this.id** is starred, use the **isStarred** method of the **localStarStorage** object.
- If the session is starred, to tag the element with the **starred** CSS class so that it is rendered correctly, use the **this.element.classList.add(this.starredClass);)** statement.
4.	In the **unsetStar** method, find the following comment:
   ```javascript
        // TODO: remove the star from the item
   ```
5.	After this comment, to remove the star from the session identified by **this.id**, add a JavaScript code. Use the **removeStar** method of the **localStarStorage** object.
6.	In the **setStar** method, find the following comment:
   ```javascript
        // TODO: add a star to the item
   ```
7.	After this comment, to add a star to the session identified by **this.id**, add a JavaScript code. Use the **addStar** method of the **localStarStorage** object.

#### Task 5: Test the application

1.	Open the **appcache.manifest** file, and then insert a version comment near the top of the file. As follows:
   ```javascript
        CACHE MANIFEST
        # version 2

        ...
   ```

>**Note**: The JavaScript files are listed in **appcache.manifest**, and they will have been cached by the web browser. Making a change to the **appcache.manifest** file forces the browser to download the updated scripts.

2.	Run the application.
3. Open the **schedule.htm** page.
4.	In Microsoft Edge, refresh the page to ensure the updated scripts are used.
5.	Close **IIS Express** by using the icon in the Windows notification area.
6.	On the **Schedule** page, click some of the stars, and then refresh the page.
7.	Verify that the same sessions are still starred.
8.	Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 6: Reset Microsoft Edge caching

1.	Configure Microsoft Edge to disable support for application caching:
- Start Microsoft Edge.
- In Microsoft Edge, to display the menu bar, press F10.
- On the **Tools** menu, click **Internet options**.
- In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click **Settings**.
- In the **Website Data Settings** dialog box, click the **Caches and databases** tab.
- Clear the **Allow website caches and databases** check box, and then click **OK**.
- In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click **OK**.
- Close Microsoft Edge.
- Close all open windows.

>**Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have updated the **Schedule** page to locally record starred sessions.

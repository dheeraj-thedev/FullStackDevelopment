# Module 10: Implementing an Adaptive User Interface

Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20480 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20480 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20480**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20480C\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20480\AllFiles\20480C\Mod01**.

# Lesson 2: Creating an Adaptive User Interface

### Demonstration: Implementing an Adaptive User Interface

#### Preparation Steps

Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/master/Allfiles**). It contains the code segments for the labs and demos in this course.

#### Demonstration Steps

1.	Read the lab scenario to the students and point out that they should read each scenario before attempting the lab for a module.
2.	Point out to the students that the exercise scenario for each exercise contains a description of what they will accomplish in the exercise, and is also essential reading.
3.  In Microsoft Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open** and then select **Project/Solution**.
4.	Browse to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Solution\Exercise 2** folder, open the **ContosoConf.sln** solution.
>**Note**: If **Security Warning for ContosoConf** dialog box appears, clear **Ask me for every project in this solution** checkbox and then click **OK**.
5.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.

>**Note**: If the **Intranet settings are turned off by default** message appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.

6.	In **Microsoft Edge**, on the navigation bar, click **About**.
7.	Press **ctrl+P** to display **Print preview**. Point out that the layout of the **About** page is modified to suit a printer; there is no navigation bar, and the text is displayed without splitting it up into three columns.
8.  Close the **About ContosoConf - Print** window.
9.	In **Microsoft Edge**, press F12 to display the **F12 Developer Tools** window.
10. In **DevTools-Microsoft Edge** click **Emulation**, under **Display** change the orientation as **Portrait** from the resolution dropdown list select **800x400**. Point out that the Microsoft Edge window changes size and matches that of a handheld device.
11.	Close the **F12 Developer Tools** window.
12.	In **Microsoft Edge**, notice that the layout of the navigation bar has changed; it is displayed over two lines, and the **Register Free** link is no longer displayed.
13.	Close **Microsoft Edge**.
14.	In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ContosoConf** project, expand the **styles** folder, and then double-click **print.css**.
15.	In the **Code Editor** window, show the CSS styles in this file. Mention that students will create this style sheet to format pages when they are sent to a printer.
16.	In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **mobile.css**.
17.	In the **Code Editor** window, scroll through the file and explain that it contains the styles used by the application when it runs in a narrow window matching that of a handheld device.
18. Close all open windows.
